## **Project Overview**

This project examines the research impact and dissemination of green open access (GOA) and toll-access (TA) publications in the chemical sciences.

- **Python scripts**: Used for mining bibliometric and altmetric data from APIs, including ChemRxiv, Scopus (via [Pybliometrics](https://github.com/pybliometrics-dev/pybliometrics)), and Crossref. The Python script is MIT licensed.
- **R scripts**: Used for statistical analyses, data visualization, and distribution modeling. The R Script is GPL3 licensed.

## **Code Organization**  
- **R Code**: Contains all scripts for analysis and visualization.
- **Python Code**: Contains scripts for data mining from APIs.

## **Important Reuse Notes**

The Python data collection script uses a combination of scholarly APIs, including ChemRxiv, Scopus, and Crossref. We have endeavored to follow the appropriate terms and usage policies of each scholarly API, and have linked to the terms and policies where possible below. Use of the Scopus API requires a valid library subscription or institutional access to use their services. Please be responsible if reusing these scripts and respect the API terms and usage policies.
